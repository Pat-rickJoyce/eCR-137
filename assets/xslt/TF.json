  "presentIllness": "The patient is a 2-month-old infant with a known diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot who presents with episodes of cyanosis during feeding, described by the mother as “blue spells” or “Tet spells.” These episodes are associated with irritability and increased work of breathing. The most recent episode occurred earlier today during breastfeeding and lasted approximately 3 minutes, resolving spontaneously after the infant was placed in a knee-chest position.\nOn arrival, the infant’s oxygen saturation was 84% on room air. No recent fever, cough, or upper respiratory symptoms were reported. Feeding has been otherwise adequate, though the mother notes the infant tires easily during feeds.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nGeneral: Alert but irritable during examination; central cyanosis noted.\nVital Signs: HR 152 bpm, RR 48 breaths/min, Temp 36.8 °C, SpO₂ 84% on room air.\nCardiac: Harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border (LUSB).\nRespiratory: Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles.\nExtremities: Mild clubbing absent; peripheral pulses palpable.\n\n\nDiagnostic Findings\n\nEchocardiogram: Findings consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, including:\n\nVentricular septal defect (VSD)\nOverriding aorta\nRight ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction\nRight ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)",
